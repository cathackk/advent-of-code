    As you ponder the solitude of space and the ever-increasing three-hour roundtrip for messages
    between you and Earth, you notice that the Space Mail Indicator Light is blinking. To help keep
    you sane, the Elves have sent you a care package.

    It's a new game for the ship's arcade cabinet! Unfortunately, the arcade is **all the way** on
    the other end of the ship. Surely, it won't be hard to build your own - the care package even
    comes with schematics.

    The arcade cabinet runs Intcode software like the game the Elves sent (your puzzle input). It
    has a primitive screen capable of drawing square tiles on a grid. The software draws tiles to
    the screen with output instructions: every three output instructions specify the `x` position
    (distance from the left), `y` position (distance from the top), and `tile id`. The `tile id` is
    interpreted as follows:

      - `0` is an **empty** tile. No game object appears in this tile.
      - `1` is a **wall** tile. Walls are indestructible barriers.
      - `2` is a **block** tile. Blocks can be broken by the ball.
      - `3` is a **horizontal paddle** tile. The paddle is indestructible.
      - `4` is a **ball** tile. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.

    For example, a sequence of output values like `1,2,3,6,5,4` would draw a **horizontal paddle
    tile** (`1` tile from the left and `2` tiles from the top) and a **ball tile** (`6` tiles from
    the left and `5` tiles from the top).

    Start the game. **How many block tiles are on the screen when the game exits?**

        >>> dummy_tape = [1, 0, 0, 0, 104, 0, 104, 0, 104, 2, 104, 1, 104, 1, 104, 2, 99]
        >>> part_1(dummy_tape)
        part 1: screen shows 2 block tiles
        2
    """

    result = Arcade(tape).play().blocks_count

    print(f"part 1: screen shows {result} block tiles")
    return result


def part_2(tape: Tape) -> int:
    """
    The game didn't run because you didn't put in any quarters. Unfortunately, you did not bring any
    quarters. Memory address `0` represents the number of quarters that have been inserted; set it
    to `2` to play for free.

    The arcade cabinet has a joystick that can move left and right. The software reads the position
    of the joystick with input instructions:

      - If the joystick is in the **neutral position**, provide `0`.
      - If the joystick is **tilted to the left**, provide `-1`.
      - If the joystick is **tilted to the right**, provide `1`.

    The arcade cabinet also has a segment display capable of showing a single number that represents
    the player's current score. When three output instructions specify `X=-1, Y=0`, the third output
    instruction is not a tile; the value instead specifies the new score to show in the segment
    display. For example, a sequence of output values like `-1,0,12345` would show `12345` as the
    player's current score.

    Beat the game by breaking all the blocks. **What is your score after the last block is broken?**

        >>> dummy_tape = [1, 0, 0, 0, 104, -1, 104, 0, 104, 12345, 99]
